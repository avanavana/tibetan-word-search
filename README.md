# Tibetan Word Search
WIP project for a word search game explicitly created for the Tibetan language and script.  Will eventually consist of web and mobile app platforms, with a shared back-end hosting optional user auth and persistence, so that users can create, save, and share custom puzzles, word lists, etc.
